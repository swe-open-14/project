          <p><strong>
            I'm a software engineer apprentice with a background in IT and a passion for exploring new technology trends and developments. After completing my degree in IT, I worked as a chef in a small restaurant, which helped me develop my creativity and passion for the art of cooking. However, I eventually realized that my true calling was in the field of technology, and I decided to pursue a career in software engineering. <br><br>
            To further my education and career prospects, I enrolled in a college called 'Hopwood Hall', where I gained practical experience and knowledge in software engineering. I worked hard to develop my skills and knowledge, and finally landed an apprenticeship at Places for People. <br><br>
            As a software engineer apprentice, I work alongside experienced developers, learning the ins and outs of programming and honing my skills in various programming languages and tools. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on people's lives.
            In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technology trends and developments, reading about innovation, and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of software engineering. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes, bringing my creativity and passion for food to the kitchen.
            Overall, I'm a driven and talented individual who is dedicated to pursuing my passions and making a positive impact on the world around me.</a>
