            Hello everyone, my name is <span style="color: bisque;">Mouhamed</span> and I'm a guy who loves football, both playing it and watching it. I was born and raised in Italy, where I spent most of my free time playing sports with my friends. As I got older, I became more and more interested in technology, and I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.
            After finisihing college, I landed an apprenticeship at P4P with the help of multiverse. I work alongside other apprentices, learning the ropes of programming and sharpening my skills as a software engineer.
            In my free time, I get on my ps5 or i pick up a book and I read. I also play football as often as I can, either with my friends or in local leagues. I believe that sports and technology have a lot in common--both require discipline, focus, and a willingness to learn and adapt to new challenges.
            As I move forward in my career, I'm excited to explore the possibilities of technology and how it can be used to make a positive impact on people's lives. My ultimate goal is to develop software that will make a difference in the world and inspire others to pursue careers in technology as well. <br>
